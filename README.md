## React Portfolio

This portfolio website was created as part of a project to strengthen my foundational skills in React. At the time, I was still a beginner, and the goal was to implement a database integration that would dynamically display information using React components. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building interactive web applications and deepened my understanding of Reactâ€™s core concepts.
